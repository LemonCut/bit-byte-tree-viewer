/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the TreeView application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset now operates on a flat 'connections' collection.
 * Public read access is granted to allow all users to view the org charts.
 * Write access (create, update, delete) is restricted to authenticated users to protect data integrity.
 * This is a common pattern for public-facing data with restricted editing rights.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /connections/{connectionId}: Stores all connection data for all trees.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read access to the main `connections` collection is public.
 * - Write access is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
